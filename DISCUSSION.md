# Stock Quotes Library - Implementation Discussion

## Compromises Made Due to Time Constraints

1. **Limited Error Handling**: While the library includes basic error handling for API responses and data validation, a production-ready library would need more comprehensive error handling, including rate limit handling, network error retries, and more detailed error messages.

2. **Basic Caching**: The implementation includes a simple in-memory caching mechanism to reduce API calls. In a production environment, a more sophisticated caching strategy would be beneficial, such as disk-based caching or integration with Redis.

3. **Limited Testing**: A comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and mocked API responses would be essential for a production library. Due to time constraints, tests were not implemented.

4. **Documentation**: While the code includes docstrings and a README, a more comprehensive documentation with examples, API reference, and tutorials would be beneficial.

5. **Limited Data Validation**: The current implementation has basic data validation, but more robust validation would be needed for a production library.

## Versioning Approach

For versioning this library, I would recommend using Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

1. **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Increment when making incompatible API changes.
2. **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: Increment when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
3. **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Increment when making backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additionally, I would:

1. Use Git tags to mark releases.
2. Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file to document changes between versions.
3. Ensure backward compatibility within the same major version.
4. Provide deprecation warnings before removing features in a future major version.
5. Consider using tools like `bumpversion` to automate version management.

## Publishing the Library

To publish this library:

1. **Register on PyPI**: Create an account on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

2. **Prepare the Package**:
   - Ensure `setup.py` is properly configured.
   - Create a `setup.cfg` file if needed.
   - Generate distribution packages:
     ```
     python -m pip install --upgrade build
     python -m build
     ```

3. **Upload to PyPI**:
   - Install Twine: `pip install twine`
   - Upload the package: `twine upload dist/*`

4. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD to automatically test and publish new versions when tags are pushed.
   - Automate version bumping and changelog generation.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Host comprehensive documentation on Read the Docs or GitHub Pages.
   - Include installation instructions, usage examples, and API reference.

## Service-Based Design Approach

If this were designed as a service rather than a library:

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/lookup/{symbol}/{date}` - For looking up stock data for a specific date.
   - `/api/v1/min/{symbol}/{range}` - For finding the minimum price.
   - `/api/v1/max/{symbol}/{range}` - For finding the maximum price.

2. **Architecture**:
   - RESTful API built with a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
   - Containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
   - Deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

3. **Caching Layer**:
   - Redis or Memcached for caching responses.
   - Scheduled background jobs to pre-fetch and update popular symbols.

4. **Authentication and Rate Limiting**:
   - API key authentication for users.
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
   - Usage quotas based on subscription tiers.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Prometheus for metrics collection.
   - ELK stack or similar for logging.
   - Alerting for service disruptions or unusual patterns.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Horizontal scaling with load balancers.
   - Database sharding for high-volume data.
   - Caching strategies to reduce load on the Alpha Vantage API.

## Additional Implementation Comments

1. **API Key Management**: The library supports both environment variables and direct parameter passing for API keys, providing flexibility for different use cases.

2. **Pandas Usage**: Pandas was chosen for data manipulation due to its powerful features for time series data and its widespread use in financial applications.

3. **Caching Strategy**: The simple in-memory cache helps reduce API calls, which is particularly important given the free tier limit of 25 calls per day.

4. **Function Naming**: The functions `get_min` and `get_max` were used instead of just `min` and `max` to avoid conflicts with Python's built-in functions.

5. **Error Handling**: The library includes basic error handling for common scenarios like API errors and missing data, but could be expanded.

## Time Spent on the Exercise

Approximately 2 hours were spent on this exercise, including:
- Designing the library structure
- Implementing the core functionality
- Writing documentation
- Creating example code
- Preparing the discussion document

## Feedback on the Exercise

This exercise was well-structured and provided a good balance of specific requirements while allowing for design decisions. The scope was appropriate for the suggested time frame, though a production-ready solution would require more time for testing and additional features.

The exercise effectively tests knowledge of:
- API integration
- Library design
- Python best practices
- Documentation
- Packaging and distribution

One suggestion would be to include a section on testing expectations, as testing is a crucial part of library development but was not explicitly mentioned in the requirements.
